# Credit-card-default-prediction

# This is my classification based machine learning project
# The credit card companies in Taiwan faced a cash and debt crisis in 2005, with a peak in delinquency anticipated for the third quarter of 2006. (Chou). Taiwan's card-issuing banks over-issued cash and credit cards to unauthorized applicants in an effort to gain market dominance. In addition, most cardholders, regardless of their capacity to pay back, abused their credit cards for consumption and racked up substantial cash and credit card debt. Consumer financial confidence was damaged by this crisis, which also provided major challenges for cardholders and banks.

* DataSet: We had provided a dataset of 30,000 rows and 25 columns.
* X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
* X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
* X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
* X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
* X5: Age (year).
* X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September,    2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
* X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
* X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.
